# Huffman
A C++ compression and decompression program that uses Huffman Coding. <br>
For a final high school project :) <br>

# Building
You can build on windows, no strings attached as always, since I only use a windows computer. <br>
For the same reason, I will not be providing any help in issues that have to do with using mac or linux, as not all the filesystem functions work on all operating systems. <br>

# Usage
The program will only take in `.txt` and `.huff`, the extension I chose :^) <br>
Usage is very simple and can only be used from the command line, being: <br>
`Huffman.exe /path/to/input.extension path/to/output.extension` <br>
You can go from `.txt` to `.huff` or from `.huff` to `.txt`.

# Examples
Some examples of the program running is provided in [here](Tests/) <br>
They were generated with these two commands: <br>
`Huffman.exe input.txt encoded.huff` <br>
`Huffman.exe encoded.huff output.txt` <br>
